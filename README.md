# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting-Sparkling-Rose-Wine-Sales
For ABC Estate Wines, analyse and forecast Wine Sales in the 20th century.Build the most optimum model(s) on the complete data and predict 12 months into the future with appropriate confidence intervals/bands.
Forecasting Sales for Sparkling & Rose Wines using various method like Simple Average ,Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA & SARIMA Models 
The project is to analyse and forecast Wine Sales in the 20th century being an analyst in ABC Estate Wines. As per the Dataset Time Series Forecasting is done using various models like simple average, linear regression ,Exponential Smoothing methods,Auto-Arima,Arima based on Acf and Pacf plots ,Auto-Sarima and Sarima model based on Acf and Pacf plot. Data pre-processing: Data Cleaning and the EDA Process is done using python libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc. The model accuracy is determined using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error accuracy metrics to find the best model forecast with least error). The models where compared based on rmse and forecast plot, it seems for Sparkling dataset ARIMA auto fit model and Triple Exponential model has performed well. For Rose data, best RMSE is observed by Brute Force Method on Triple Exponential Smoothing. Best parameter for the same are alpha=0.3, beta=0.4 and gamma=0.3. ARIMA model using Acf and Pacf plot is the second best and the model is ARIMA (4,1,3) Conclusion : For doing the best forecast on Rose dataset we will use Triple Exponential Smoothing .
